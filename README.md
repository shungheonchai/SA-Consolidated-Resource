# SA Consolidated Resource (Code)
This is the central repository that will eventually contain all customized code that SA's have started for demo and POC's. Because it is using submodules, all this page does it keeping the index of all of these resources and does not need direct dependency. Go to the specific submodule that you like and run `git submodule update --remote`
