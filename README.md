# SA Consolidated Resource (Code)
This is the central repository that will eventually contain all customized code that SA's have started for demo and POC's. Because it is using submodules, all this page does it keeping the index of all of these resources and does not need direct dependency. 

## How to Use
Go to the specific submodule that you like and run the following
`git submodule update --remote`

## How to Add
`git submodule add <repository-url> <path>`
`git submodule update --init --recursive`
